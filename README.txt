What is UseBeakerPlugin?
========================

`UseBeakerPlugin` is similar to `BeakerAuthTktPlugin
<http://bitbucket.org/iElectric/repozewhopluginsbeaker_tkt/>`_ but instead of
storing pickled user, group and other objects in session data it stores only the
user id.

Mercurial repository is located at `bitbucket.org
<http://bitbucket.org/kaukas/repoze.who.plugins.use_beaker/>`_.
